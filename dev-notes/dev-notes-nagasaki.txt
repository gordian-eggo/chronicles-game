DEVELOPER'S NOTES

2-21-2020, 1354H (initial version)
3-1-2020, 1319H  (second edit):

	No other specified races other than humans at the time of this writing. Other magical creatures have not been fleshed outin detail.

	Note: Leave the story-related technicalities to Kyle. We're here to handle the back. Just include the other specifications later on.

	GENERAL:

		Relationship class : defines relationship between 2 Humans/Mystics/						 etc. Keep it between 2 for simplicity, the 						 fans can generate their own Babaylan webs.

		Basic class: Creature. Includes all things that a basic creature would have.

			> (sanity_level) is a bit harder to define in this case but it should be connected to (corruption_level)
		
			> (mana_level) determined by (current_mana) and (max_mana)
			
			> (hp_level) determined by (current_HP) and (max_HP)
	
			> weaknesses[] differ for each individual

			> constitution (didn't add this yet, research it)

	Humans
		> may or may not have magical aptitude (is_caster = true/false)
		
		> magical abilities determined by (summoner_lvl, elemental_lvl, distortion_lvl, illusion_lvl). Casters can be capable of two or more magical classifications with additional training. The caster may learn some skills from outside of their natural ability set, but not all. (Make a system to determine which spells/abilities are available for which classes.)

		> status_effects (not sure what to do with this, maybe a HashMap?) because some buffs like perception blocking increase evasion and so on

		> (faction) denotes the individual's faction

		> (is_infected) determines whether or not the human has been afflicted by void magic

			(void_form) : determines whether the human is an Afflicted/Corrupted/Lost/Shade

		
	Magic Classifications for Humans

		SUMMONER    : allows caster to form contracts with Mystics and have access to their power and abilities.

			> HashMap for storing contracts with specified Mystic objects (see if C# has its own version of a HashMap)

					KEY 			   : 		VALUE

				Contract (6-digit int) : 		Mystic

			TYPES OF SUMMONER CONTRACT
				
				Type I: allows the Mystic to exist outside of mana reserves while being at the summoner's service

				Type II*: requires special rituals and training to be able to handle the stress of fusing the summoner and the mystic (rituals can temporarily affect health/mana/sanity?)

		* Fusing rituals for Type II contracts affects health more than mana but this level of affectation can decrease due to training and other factors ex. constitution. 

		
		ELEMENTAL   : standard four-elements type magic user

			controlled_elements[] : array of one or more elements the caster can 							control

			<element>_affinity 	  : caster's level of affinity with the element

		* Training affects elemental ability but a lot depends on affinity and other factors. Some skills can only be learned by certain people.

		DISTORTION  : casters distort the laws of physics

		ILLUSION    : distorts target's perceptive abilities

			Senses affected:

				Touch
				Hearing
				Sight

?: Might not include these to make things easier. 

		VOID        : outlawed magic capable of corrupting the user

Tech issues:

	> how to implement different interfaces dynamically?

		Ex. public class Caster extends Human implements <desired magic_classification>
